This is a super simple .py base asteroids type game I have been working on but in all honesty, I am way out of my depth. Code is python based, and I have been using IDLE python to create code and run to test it via emulation.
Basic game structure. Single player sprite (green circle) shoots bullets by either holding or bashing the space bar, movement is achieved with directional buttons.
Power-ups are small yellow squares and these allow different gun functions.
Large blue enemy sprites will kill you if you crash into them and need to be shot to gain points.
At 1500 points small red enemy sprites will appear and these you can collide with and this will not kill you. These sprites are worth double points.

At every 5000 point intervals red hearts will appear and they are extra lives. Unfortunately when you collide with a blue enemy sprite you loose 2x lives and I cannot figure out why this happens but I’m so new at this it’s a miracle I have got this far.

Have some fun with it, feel free to add to another version so long as you retain the original and feel free to tell me here I am going wrong. You will see in the code I have tried to change the player sprite to an image. This has not worked and the code still reflect incorrect information but it still runs for me and I have no idea how to change it back.
